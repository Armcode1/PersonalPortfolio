            Hi, Iâ€™m Arman Ali, a passionate Full-Stack Developer and tech enthusiast with a strong foundation in Computer Science Engineering. I hold a Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech) degree from Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam Technical University.

            I specialize in building end-to-end web applications, combining intuitive frontend design with efficient backend functionality. My expertise includes technologies like React, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and JavaScript, enabling me to create scalable and user-friendly solutions.

            Driven by a desire for continuous learning, Iâ€™m constantly exploring new tools and techniques to enhance my skills. I also have a keen interest in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) and enjoy solving complex problems to improve my coding proficiency.

            ðŸš€ My goal is to contribute to impactful projects that make a difference and push the boundaries of technology.

            When Iâ€™m not coding, youâ€™ll find me mentoring others in their tech journey or exploring the latest trends in web development.
